    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
      <p>
          As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 para. 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG).
          However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information
          or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
      </p>
      <p>
          Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.
          However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time when we become aware of a specific legal infringement.
          Upon becoming aware of such legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.
      </p>
      <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
      <p>
        Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot
        assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for
        the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal
        contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.<br>
        A permanent content control of the linked pages is, however, not reasonable without concrete indications of an infringement.
        Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
      </p>
      <h3>Copyright</h3>
      <p>
        The content and works on these pages created by the site operators are subject to German copyright law. The duplication,
        processing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the
        respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for private, non-commercial use.<br>
        Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In
        particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, we
        request notification. Upon becoming aware of violations, we will remove such content immediately.
